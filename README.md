 This HTML/CSS code snippet creates a sleek login form interface with input fields for username and password, and a "Login" button, enclosed in a styled container for visual appeal and user-friendliness.

Overview:- The project involves creating a stylish and functional login form using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. The form will provide users with fields to input their username and password, along with a login button to submit the form.

Key Features:-

User Input Fields: The login form will include input fields for the username and password, allowing users to enter their credentials securely.

Styling: CSS will be used to design the login form, making it visually appealing and intuitive for users. This includes customizing the colors, fonts, and layout to match the desired aesthetic.

Validation: JavaScript can optionally be implemented to provide form validation, ensuring that users enter valid information before submitting the form. This can include checking for the presence of both username and password, as well as their format (e.g., minimum length requirements).

Responsive Design: The login form will be designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.
